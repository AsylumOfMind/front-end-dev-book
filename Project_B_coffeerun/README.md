Was finally able to get previous issue solved
Still tripping over hurdles. My face really hurts.
Got what I think was the hard part taken care of.
Ended up making a json-server to serve up the API for POSTing and GETing and that part now runs alright.
Editing the program to make the current inputted data play well with the json on the server as well as restrict multiple 
of the same entries. Deletion of entries basically coded in at this point, just needs the visual.
Keep getting caught up in promises. :smiley-face::gunfinger:
