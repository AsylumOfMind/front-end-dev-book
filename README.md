Projects 1-4 are in Project A as Persona 5
Projects 5 & 6 are in Project B as RMDb

The star rating bar does a weird jittery thing after making a selection if you hover back over it. I can't figure out how to resolve it.
Not a really big deal, but I don't like it.

There is also 2 indexes for project 6; one normal and the other pre-loaded with inputs.
